## My daily dashboard

A simple single page interactive dashboard that is to act as a single point of truth for viewing various things I like to look at everyday.

Some of the widgets might include:
* A dynamic, changing Twitter feed.
* Weather forecast for the day.
* Changes in the stock market.
* The front page of Reddit.
* Breaking news from a developer friendly news site.
* Maybe more! (Maybe not)

When in development mode run ```bundle exec dashing start``` to get the dashboard going
